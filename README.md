# Group-project-2

Project day 1: brainstorming

github creation figuring out collaboration with forking and pull requests
-rules to prevent accidental push to main branch

team division: 
  nick, matt, isaac - front end and react
  alex, dan- backend and sql

planning: quiz game

categories to pick from : science, math, and english
spa app to keep simple

spanish translation with use state variable

3 categories of multiple choice to keep inputs simple

hosting with heroku- dan is already on, $3/month is reasonable

postgres collaboration

sql and react as main formats

navbar for categories/solutions page

information for each question with a card

scoring system (keep it simple with right/wrong count)- would be nice to expand if time permits

drivers ed test as example- pulls random 40 questions from pool of 250 questions
10 ?s from each category

rng to get question-id from pool

front-end: card shows question information

writing questions vs pulling questions from existing api?
how would we store our own written questions?
wrong answers can be tedious to create

collaboration with discord server- all in
-trello vs github projects vs gira
trello workspace created and generation of boards

group distracted with gaming conversation- redirected to be back on track

the-trivia-api.com for external api 
consult with instructor (submission of own questions)
features, arichtecture, project board, finish planning
reviewing planning-1vs2 people reviewing, prevention of bugs, check pull requests

working through initial project set-up and pull request procedure 
successfully submitted and accepted pull requests by all members
